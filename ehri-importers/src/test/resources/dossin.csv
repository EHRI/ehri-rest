From July 1942 up to the liberation in 1944, the barrack functioned as SS-Sammellager Mecheln for Jews and Gypsies. After the end of the Second World War, the building again served its original military purpose. In 1975 the military left and the building fell into disuse. This is why the complex was divided into apartments in the 1980s. At the request of the  Association of former Jewish Deportees in Belgium and the Central Jewish Consistory of Belgium, space was made available for a museum on Holocaust and Human Rights. The Flemish Government, the Province of Antwerp and the City of Mechelen financed the purchase of Kazerne Dossin’s ground floor and the basement of the right wing. The Jewish Museum of Deportation and Resistance (JMDR) was officially inaugurated on 7 May 1995 by King Albert II. On 22 June 2001, the Flemish Government approved the basic concept which was to lead to the establishment of the renewed museum: ""Kazerne Dossin – Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre on Holocaust and Human Rights"".
