         <p>M.19 - The Friesland District Joodse Raad (Jewish Council) Collection, the Netherlands, 1940-1943 The Collection contains correspondence between the Friesland district Joodse Raad and the Amsterdam Joodse Raad on various issues, and correspondence of the Joodse Raad with various organizations regarding help to Dutch Jews in camps and help to Jewish refugees from Germany. There are also reports received from the Amsterdam Joodse Raad regarding the Jews, documentation of decrees and restrictions on Dutch Jews, Jewish education, Jewish owned property, mixed marriages, persecution and deportation of Dutch Jews. The Friesland Joodse Raad documentation includes correspondence and directives from the Amsterdam Joodse Raad to its principal representatives in Leeuwarden and directives and correspondence from the Leeuwarden Joodse Raad to its representatives in Drachten, Gorredijk, Sneek and Harlingen. Besides the Joodse Raad material, the documentation also contains material from the Coordinatie Commissie (Coordinating Committee) and the Leeuwarden community from the years 1938-1943. Archival history: The Friesland Joodse Raad representatives were the Chief Rabbi, Rabbi A. S. Levinson and Attorney M. Troostwik. Rabbi Levinson was deported, and perished in Bergen-Belsen. Attorney Troostwijk escaped and went into hiding in August 1943. Before his escape, Attorney Troostwijk entrusted all the documentation to the Leeuwarden community comptroller for safe-keeping. After the war, Mr. H. N. Been was responsible for the documentation which he submitted to Yad Vashem in 1958. Scope: The documentation includes 37 files sorted by subject matter. Four files arrived at Yad Vashem already sorted, and they have been left in their original form. For technical reasons, the list was compiled in German. Ms. Bronka Klibansky sorted and entered the material with the help of Mr. H. N. Been; the work was completed 05 April 1959.</p>
