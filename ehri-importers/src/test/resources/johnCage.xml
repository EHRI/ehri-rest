            <p>J
                ohn Cage, justifiably famous as a composer, was also very much interested in mycology.
                40
                He was born in Los Angeles on the 5th of September, 1912. He attended Pomona College, but
                dropped out after two years and headed to Europe. In 1930, while still in Paris
                , Cage
                became interested in both modern music and modern painting. Soon he left and went to
                Mallorca, where he began painting and writing music himself. The following year he returned
                to California, settling in at Pacific Palisades. While writing music for
                the piano, he met
                Richard Buhlig, who was the first pianist to play the Opus II of Schoenberg. Though Buhlig
                was not a teacher of composition, he agreed to help Cage with writing music. From Buhlig he
                went to Henry Cowell [1933
                -
                34] and, at Cowell's sugges
                tion, to Adolph Weiss in preparation
                for studies with Arnold Schoenberg. In order to work with Schoenberg, he gave up painting
                and concentrated on music.</p>
            <p>After two years Cage became an assistant to the film maker Oskar Fischinger, while doing
                librar
                y research work. He married Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff, a student of the bookbinder
                Hazel Dreis. By 1937 he had found a group of modern dancers who were interested in his
                music and could put it to use, resulting in his move to Seattle, where he was given
                a job
                as a dance accompanist at the Cornish School. Within a couple of years Cage and his wife
                moved back south to San Francisco, and then in 1941 they moved to Chicago, where he joined
                the faculty of Moholy Nagy's School of Design in Chicago. While there
                he was commissioned
                to write the sound effects music for a CBS Columbia Workshop Play. He was told by the sound
                effects engineer that anything he could imagine was possible. What he wrote, however, was
                impractical and too expensive; and the work had to be
                rewritten for percussion orchestra,
                copied, and rehearsed in the few remaining days and nights before its broadcast. The play,
                incidentally, was <title>The City Wears a Slouch Hat</title> by Kenneth Patchen. In 1942
                Cage and his wife Xenia moved to New Yo
                rk, where within a couple of years he began working
                with Merce Cunningham. He and Xenia were divorced in 1945.</p>
            <p>In the late 1950's Cage taught occasionally at New York's New School for Social
                Research. It was during that time that he met Guy Nearing,
                who was to become his mentor in
                the study of mushrooms and other wild edible plants. With three other friends they founded
                the New York Mycological Society. In 1964 Cage was given the North American Mycological
                Association's Award for Contributions to Ama
                teur Mycology, which is "given annually to
                recognize a person who has contributed extraordinarily to the advancement of amateur
                mycology." It was, however, through Cage's enthusiasm for the work of English master
                gardener Alan Chadwick and his "Student Gar
                den Project" on the new campus of the University
                of California at Santa Cruz that Special Collections received his "collection of mushroom
                books and mushroomiana".</p>
            <p>John Cage died in New York City on August 12th, 1992.</p>
            <p>"Coming back to the noti
                on that my thought is changing. Say it isn't. One thing,
                however, that keeps it moving is that I'm continually finding new teachers with whom I
                study. I had studied with Richard Buhlig, Henry Cowell, Arnold Schoenberg, Daisetz Suzuki,
                Guy Nearing. Now I'm
                studying with N.O. Brown, Marshall McLuhan, Buckminster Fuller, Marcel
                Duchamp. In connection with my current studies with Duchamp, it turns out that I'm a poor
                chessplayer. My mind seems in some respect lacking, so that I make obviously stupid moves.
                I do
                not for a moment doubt that this lack of intelligence affects my music and thinking
                generally. However, I have a redeeming quality: I was gifted with a sunny disposition."
