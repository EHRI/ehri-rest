     * List available resources. The default behaviour is to
     * return a page of 20 items.
     * <p/>
     * The default list limit can be overridden using the <code>limit</code>
     * parameter, and disabled completely using a value of -1.
     * <p/>
     * Item lists are paginated using the <code>page</code> parameter.
     * <p/>
     * The page, limit, and total number of items is returned in the Content-Range response
     * header in the form:
     *
     * <pre><code>page=1; count=20; total=50</code></pre>

     * no count of total items will be performed. This is more efficient when returning large
     * numbers of items or when limiting is disabled completely.
     * <p/>
     * Example:
     * <pre>
     *     <code>
     * curl http://localhost:7474/ehri/[RESOURCE]/list?page=5&limit=10
     *     </code>
